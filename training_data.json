Combining robust construction with advanced navigation technology, it delivers exceptional efficiency, precision, and reliability — even in confined spaces.The RILOG1500165 is ideal for:Heavy-load transport and pallet handling in warehouses and production facilities. Automated material flow in areas with mixed human and robot traffic. High-precision positioning in logistics, manufacturing, and distribution centers.Key Benefits of the RILOG1500165 Handling Robot: Efficiency: Faster handling, higher throughput. Precision: Accurate, consistent positioning. Safety: Reduces workplace risks. Cost Savings: Cuts labor costs, boosts productivity. Flexibility: Integrates and adapts easily. 24/7 Operation: Uninterrupted performance. The Robot Industries RILOG1500165 ha​ndling robot is a state-of-the-art narrow aisle handling robot, ideal for a wide range of material handling processes. This mini laser navigation and handling AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) is designed to operate efficiently in various environments, including those with narrow aisles.Key Features:360° Rotation Capability: The Robot Industries RILOG1500165 handling robot can rotate 360° in place, allowing for exceptional maneuverability in confined spaces.Narrow Aisle Operation: Capable of navigating aisles as narrow as 1.8 meters, making it a hot-selling product throughout the season.Safety Devices: The vehicle body is equipped with safety devices such as anti-collision edge strips to ensure safe operation. Previous Next RMS, based on an AI scheduling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, achieves optimal task allocation, multi-path planning, and robot traffic control management, enabling efficient, coordinated, and cooperative operation of swarm robots without interfering with each other. RMS monitors the robots' operating status, displaying and recording status in real time. It also rationally schedules the robots' automated charging tasks based on the charging station's operating status and task execution.
