Login or Register to view price ​Request price SKU: N/A Share : Description Specification Description RI WD 3D FreeTeach Industrial Welding Station The Future of Robotic Welding – No Manual Programming Required In today’s industrial environment, where skilled labor shortages, rising costs, and increasing quality demands challenge manufacturers, intelligent welding automation is no longer optional. The RI WD 3D FreeTeach Industrial Welding Station redefines robotic welding by completely eliminating traditional manual programming and transforming welding into a fast, flexible, and efficient process. What is the RI WD 3D FreeTeach Industrial Welding StationThe RI WD 3D FreeTeach is a fully automated industrial welding station equipped with 3D vision technology and intelligent welding path planning software. Unlike traditional “teach & repeat” robotic systems, it: requires no manual welding path programming automatically recognizes part geometry autonomously generates the optimal welding path quickly adapts to different workpieces The result is a dramatic reduction in setup time and consistent welding quality, even for complex parts. FreeTeach Technology – Teach-Free WeldingThe key innovation of the RI WD station is FreeTeach (Teach-Free Welding) technology. The operator no longer needs to manually teach the robot. The system: scans the part using 3D vision automatically detects welding seams calculates optimal welding parameters (speed, current, angle) performs the weld with high precision This approach makes robotic welding accessible even for companies without dedicated robot programmers. Key Features 3D vision system for automatic part recognition Autonomous welding path planning High precision and repeatability (±0.02 mm) Compatibility with multiple industrial robots (RI, FANUC, ABB, Estun, etc.) MIG/MAG welding support (350A – 500A) Advanced welding functions: corner welding, circular welding, multi-pass welding, weaving Automatic torch cleaning system Real Production Benefits Reduced Setup Time Fast configuration for new parts enables quick changeovers between different production batches. Consistent Welding Quality Eliminating manual programming ensures uniform, repeatable welds that meet industrial standards. Maximum Flexibility Ideal for small and medium batch production, where part geometry changes frequently. Lower Operating Costs Reduced dependence on highly skilled welders and fewer defects result in a fast return on investment. Application AreasThe RI WD 3D FreeTeach Industrial Welding Station is ideal for: metal structure fabrication automotive components and subassemblies heavy machinery and industrial equipment customized production and special projectsWhy Choose RI WD 3D FreeTeach✔️ True automation without manual programming ✔️ Fast integration into existing production lines ✔️ Increased productivity and weld quality ✔️ A future-ready solution for modern industry The RI WD 3D FreeTeach Industrial Welding Station is not just a welding system—it is an intelligent automation platform that fundamentally changes how industrial welding is performed. It is the ideal solution for companies aiming to stay competitive, efficient, and ready for the future of manufacturing. Front & Rear Double-Station M-type workstation adopts front and rear double-station arrangement, the robot (welding) and the ope-rator (loading and unloading) work alternately between the two stations. This way can avoid or reduce the robot waiting time and improve productivity. Omni-Directional Welding The workstation is equipped with an external axis vertical turnover indexer, which can coordinate the robot to complete the welding of weld seams in all angular directions. Modular Sizing Single workstation is suitable for the production of products with length less than 1.8m and width less than 1.5m: Double workstation is suitable for the production of products with length less than 3m and wid-th less than 1.5m.

Its fully automated navigation system streamlines the adjustment of backstops and rams, simplifying machine setup and significantly reducing commissioning time.Axis configuration, I/O point settings, and auxiliary function parameters can be precisely customized to meet the specific requirements of each bending application. The CNC press brake uses either standard or custom molds to bend cold metal sheets into parts with various geometric cross-sections. It's a metal forming machine specifically designed for processing cold-rolled sheet metal. The RI press brake is equipped with intelligent features, including a touchscreen controller and a crowning system, which simplify the bending process and significantly enhance overall efficiency. INTUITIVE CONTROLLER The user-friendly graphical touch controller gives full play to the bending performance of the machine.SERVO-CONTROLLED HYDRAULIC SYSTEM Hydraulic components are manufactured to a high standard to ensure excellent performance.RIGID STRUCTURE All HUSONE Series are designed and built utilizing a welded one-piece frame machined to guarantee machine precision.LINEAR ENCODERS High-precision linear encoders provide high positioning accuracy and repeat-ability.BACK GAUGE The newly designed back gauge is a robust construction featuring 2-axis or 4-axis configurations for greater flexibility and increased productivity.CNC CROWNING CNC mechanical crowning. High precision, improving the precision of bending angle and linearity. Crowning System During the bending process, stress can cause deformation in both the ram and worktable. The crowning system compensates for this ram deformation, significantly improving the press brake's precision. This system is particularly useful for manufacturing high-precision products such as stainless steel components.

Real-World Case Study, Manufacturing Facility Automation A major automotive components manufacturer in Central Europe faced challenges maintaining cleanliness across its 15,000 m² production floor, leading to micro-dust contamination and downtime for manual cleaning.After integrating two RI autonomous industrial cleaning robots, the company achieved:68% reduction in cleaning labor costs43% increase in uptime through automated off-shift cleaning cycles100% compliance with ISO 14644-1 cleanliness standardsROI achieved in under 9 monthsToday, the robots operate autonomously during night shifts, reporting performance metrics directly to the facility’s cloud dashboard, a seamless, self-managing cleaning process. FAQ about Industrial & Autonomous Cleaning Robots How do cleaning robots work?Autonomous industrial cleaning robots use a combination of AI, LiDAR mapping, ultrasonic sensors, and computer vision to navigate facilities safely and efficiently. They scrub, vacuum, or disinfect surfaces while automatically avoiding obstacles and optimizing cleaning paths for maximum coverage.What are three facts about industrial cleaning robots?1. Modern robotic floor scrubbers can clean over 30,000 sq. ft per hour with minimal human supervision.2. They reduce cleaning-related labor costs by up to 70% while maintaining consistent quality.3. Many models support IoT connectivity and real-time performance monitoring through cloud dashboards.How much does an industrial cleaning robot cost?The industrial cleaning robot price typically ranges between $15,000 and $75,000 USD, depending on size, autonomy level, battery capacity, and whether it’s a robotic floor scrubber, vacuum robot, or UVC disinfection model.What is an autonomous industrial cleaning robot?It’s a self-driving cleaning system that performs floor scrubbing, sweeping, or disinfection without manual control. Using AI navigation and machine learning, it adapts to new layouts and schedules cleaning based on occupancy data.What is a robotic floor scrubber?A robotic floor scrubber automates floor cleaning using rotating brushes, suction systems, and onboard water tanks. It’s ideal for factories, warehouses, airports, and retail spaces where large areas need regular, deep cleaning.Are autonomous cleaning robots safe to use around people?Yes. They feature collision avoidance, proximity sensors, and automatic shutdown when detecting human presence, ensuring safe operation in shared workspaces.Do industrial robot scrubbers require maintenance?Minimal maintenance is needed, mainly brush replacement, water tank cleaning, and sensor calibration. Ri Cleaning Robots are designed for easy service access and remote diagnostics.Can autonomous cleaning robots replace human janitors?They assist. Robots handle repetitive floor cleaning while staff focus on inspection, detailing, or sanitation tasks that need human precision.
